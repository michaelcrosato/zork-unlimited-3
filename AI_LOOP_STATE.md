# AI Loop State

This file is the handoff point for future autonomous agents.

## Current Objective

Make the CYOA engine and story capable of indefinite AI-assisted improvement
through repeatable planning, playtesting, validation, agent execution, and
commits.

## Last Known Priorities

- Improve true-ending discoverability in normal play.
- Reduce unfinished random playtest runs.
- Keep MCP play as a required part of story/gameplay changes.

## Standard Cycle

1. Run `./loop.sh` for the full autonomous bash loop, or `./loop.sh --once` for one bounded pass.
2. Let the loop generate the newest report and prompt in `ai-runs/`.
3. If `AI_AGENT_CMD` is active, the loop passes that prompt to the coding agent on stdin.
4. Choose one small improvement from the evidence.
5. Implement and test it.
6. Run `npm run health`.
7. Actually play one route through MCP or CLI.
8. Commit and push a coherent milestone when green.

## Handoff Notes

- `npm run health` is the required pre-commit gate.
- `npm run ai:loop` repeats evidence-gathering and optional agent execution forever until interrupted.
- `AI_AGENT_CMD` controls which agent the loop invokes.
- `AI_LOOP_EVIDENCE_ONLY=1` disables agent execution while preserving reports and prompts.
- Generated reports, saves, and transcripts are ignored by git.
